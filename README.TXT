PrecisionCursor Plugin for QGIS
===============================

What does it do?
----------------

PrecisionCursor is a little plugin for QGIS that turns the mouse cursor into a
plain arrow or crosshair, facilitating precision pointing whenever you need it.

Once the plugin is activated, it shows a button (light blue with a white arrow
cursor) with a dropdown side menu in the Plugins toolbar. In the dropdown menu,
you can choose what you want the mouse cursor to look like: System standard
arrow or crosshair shape, or one of the pointer shapes that come shipped with
this plugin.
When you click your favourite cursor shape, the mouse cursor turns into that
shape, no matter how it looked before. Nothing else changes; the previously
active map tool remains active.

When you press the PrecisionCursor main button, the mouse cursor turns back
into whatever it would look like normally.
You can now switch to your mouse cursor of choice at any time by clicking the
main button.


What is this good for?
--------------------
In QGIS, the appearance of the mouse cursor changes to indicate which map
tool is active at the moment. Some tools, like drawing tools, give you a cursor
with a clear focus for precise action. Others don't, like for example the
Panning Tool with its "Open Hand" cursor.
This is very impractical in some situations, for example when doing
Reverse Georeferencing (a technique where you tape or weigh a paper map to a
graphics tablet and then pan and zoom the QGIS map viewport with the stylus
to show exactly the same view).
The PrecisionCursor Plugin allows you to switch to a cursor with clear focus
at will whenever needed.
