PrecisionCursor Plugin for QGIS
===============================

What does it do?
----------------

PrecisionCursor is a little plugin for QGIS that turns the mouse cursor into a plain arrow, facilitating precision pointing wherever you need it.

Once the plugin is activated, it shows a new button in the Plugins toolbar (light blue with a white arrow cursor). When you press the button, the mouse cursor turns into an arrow, no matter how it lookes before. Nothing else changes; the previously active map tool remains active.
When you press the PrecisionCursor button again, the mouse cursor turns back into whatever it looks like normally.


What is it good for?
--------------------
In QGIS, the appearance of the mouse cursor changes to indicate which map tool is active at the moment. Some tools, like drawing tools, give you a cursor with a clear focus for precise action. Others don't, like for example the Panning Tool with its "Open Hand" cursor.
This is very impractical in some situations, for example when doing Reverse Georeferencing, a technique where you tape or weigh a paper map to a graphics tablet and then pan and zoom the QGIS map viewport with the stylus to show exactly the same view. 
The PrecisionCursor Plugin allows you to switch to a cursor with clear focus at will whenever needed.
